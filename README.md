# Gen-AI-based-fashion-product-recommendation-system
Fashion Recommender System with Chatbot Integration This project implements a Fashion Recommender System using state-of-the-art machine learning models and a chatbot interface. The system recommends fashion products based on uploaded images and responds to user queries through a chat interface.

Technologies Used:

Streamlit: For building the user interface and dashboard.

TensorFlow: Utilized for image feature extraction and recommendation.

Sentence Transformers: Used for text embeddings and similarity calculations.

Hugging Face Transformers: Integrated for natural language processing tasks.

MySQL Connector: For user authentication and database operations.

PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for image processing tasks.

scikit-learn: Employed for nearest neighbor search for recommendation.

PyTorch: Utilized for text and image embeddings.

Matplotlib: Used for displaying images and visualizations.

Key Features:

Login and Registration: Users can authenticate themselves before accessing the system.

Image Upload and Recommendation: Users can upload images of fashion products, and the system provides recommendations based on image similarity.

Chatbot Integration: Includes a chatbot interface that responds to user queries and provides additional product information.

Dashboard: Provides a user-friendly dashboard for navigation and interaction with the system.

Usage:
